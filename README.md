# Apache Load Balancing in AWS

# Overview

This project demonstrates the configuration of a basic web server load balancing setup using iptables, Apache, and multiple synchronized virtual machines in an AWS environment. 
The goal was to gain hands-on experience with server cloning, secure file synchronization, and traffic distribution in a controlled lab environment.

# Key Features:
- Configured four Apache web servers using Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for rapid deployment.

- Set up iptables rules to perform basic load balancing by randomly forwarding HTTP traffic across multiple servers.

- Synchronized website content between servers using rsync, SSH key authentication, and cron jobs.

- Validated load balancing using a custom Python script to simulate traffic and monitor request distribution.
